# Weather Forecasting Application

## Description
This is a Python-based application that utilizes historical weather data and machine learning algorithms to predict future weather patterns. The project demonstrates the use of classes, data processing, and plotting techniques.

## Features
- Fetches historical weather data from an API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap)
- Cleans and preprocesses the data for analysis
- Trains a linear regression model to predict future temperatures
- Visualizes the predicted vs. actual temperature over time

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/mrchandrayee/weather-forecast.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
1. Obtain an API key from a weather data provider (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
2. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in the code with your actual API key.
3. Run the application: `python main.py`
